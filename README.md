about Resume
This mini HTML CSS project is my first attemp to use my theoretical knowlege to create some physical measures to skills. In this repository I have created a sample resume for which i have used the concept of 
* Different tags of HTML
* different types of CSS adding to the the HTML file.
* concept of flex 
* concept of grid
* various CSS styling to make the page more attractive.
If anyone reading this.. i would like to get the comments on my first attemp and learn better and necessary changes to my project
